# Build Engine — Architecture

This document describes the engine foundation implemented so far. See
`claude.md` for the full architecture contract this engine follows, and
`PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md` for the plugin lifecycle in detail.

## Core Principle

The core provides generic verbs (create an entity, attach a component,
publish/subscribe to an event, register a plugin). It has no knowledge of
any specific game content — no martial arts, no magic, no combat. All of
that belongs in plugins, built on top of this foundation, in later work.

## Services implemented so far

### EntityId (`lib/src/entity/entity_id.dart`)
An immutable value wrapping a sequential `int`, assigned in creation order.
Sequential (not random) so a run can be reproduced from seed + initial
state + actions.

### EntityRegistry (`lib/src/entity/entity_registry.dart`)
Tracks which `EntityId`s are currently alive. `create()` allocates a new id
and publishes `EntityCreated`; `destroy(id)` removes it and publishes
`EntityDestroyed`. Takes an `EventBus` via constructor injection — there is
no global/singleton event bus.

### ComponentStore (`lib/src/component/component_store.dart`)
Generic storage for components, keyed by the component's runtime `Type`.
Deliberately has **no reference to `EntityRegistry` or `EventBus`** — it is
independently constructible and testable. This is a boundary worth keeping:
it means you can reason about "how components are stored" completely
separately from "how entities are created and destroyed".

### EventBus (`lib/src/event/event_bus.dart`)
Typed publish/subscribe. `subscribe<T>(handler)` registers a handler for
events whose exact runtime type is `T`; `publish<T>(event)` dispatches to
every such handler. There is no dispatch across a type hierarchy (a
subscriber for a supertype will not receive a subtype's events) — every
event type used so far is a concrete, non-hierarchical class, so this has
not been a limitation. Revisit if a future plugin needs otherwise.

## Integrating EntityRegistry and ComponentStore

Because `ComponentStore` does not know about `EntityRegistry`, component
cleanup on entity destruction is not automatic. Wire them together by
subscribing to `EntityDestroyed`:

```dart
final events = EventBus();
final registry = EntityRegistry(events);
final components = ComponentStore();

events.subscribe<EntityDestroyed>((event) {
  // Call components.remove<T>(event.id) for every component type your
  // application actually uses — ComponentStore has no registry of "every
  // type that has ever been added", so this list is the caller's to know.
  components.remove<SomeComponentType>(event.id);
});
```

This is also the pattern for bootstrapping the three core services together
for a `PluginContext` — construct one `EventBus`, pass the same instance to
both `EntityRegistry` and the `PluginContext`, so plugins that subscribe via
`context.events` actually see entity lifecycle events:

```dart
final events = EventBus();
final context = PluginContext(
  entities: EntityRegistry(events),
  components: ComponentStore(),
  events: events,
);
```

## Dependency rule

Plugins depend on core; core never depends on any plugin. Within core,
services depend only downward toward more primitive services — for
example `EntityRegistry` depends on `EventBus`, never the reverse. See
`PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md` for how this applies across plugins.

## Determinism

`EntityId` allocation is sequential, not random, specifically so that a
run's entity ids are reproducible given the same sequence of `create()`
calls. No service in this pass uses `dart:math`'s `Random()` or any other
non-deterministic source — there is no RNG service yet; one will be added,
injectable rather than global, when gameplay systems that need randomness
are built.

## What's deliberately not here yet

Rule Engine, Effect Engine, Modifier Engine, Query Engine, Spatial/Container
Engine, Resource Engine, Scheduler, RNG Service, Asset/Data Registry,
Serialization. Each is a separate future subsystem, to be brainstormed and
planned on its own rather than stubbed out speculatively here.
